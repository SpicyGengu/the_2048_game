It's just 2048 but not as good looking.
To run, you first have to compile the code with cargo. The command is "cargo build" or "cargo release".
After compilation just run the .exe file with the same name. While the game is running it picks up on the keys A, W, D, S and Q. A, W, D and S are direction inputs while Q is for quitting the game.
